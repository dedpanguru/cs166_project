# CS166 Project: Token Authentication vs Session Authentication
## Overall Idea
- Build JWT authentication server
- Build Session authentication server
  - Optionally, build a frontend for each server 
- Ensure that server code is available and accessible on GitHub
- Containerize both through Docker and upload them to DockerHub
- Attackers of each server prepare respective servers on their local machine 
- Attackers plan and execute attack on each server, screenshotting the whole attack process and the results
- Attackers upload their screenshots and a write-up of their attack into this repo
### More information on how to setup each of the servers is found inside the specific server folders
